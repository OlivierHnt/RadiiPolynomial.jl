# State of the art

The study of complex [dynamical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system) requires numerical computations to access the dynamics. While numerical methods provide accurate approximations, they often come at the cost of rounding, discretization errors and the surrender of an a posteriori error bound between the approximation and the exact solution of the original problem.

Computer-assisted proofs aim to **validate numerical simulations** and **derive mathematical theorems**, thereby binding computational results with topological, geometric and qualitative methods of nonlinear theory.

[RadiiPolynomial.jl](https://github.com/OlivierHnt/RadiiPolynomial.jl) is a Julia package to conduct the computational steps of a type of computer-assisted proofs referred to as the *radii polynomial approach* (see the next section below).

In the context of the radii polynomial approach, we discretize functions spaces with respect to a basis that best fit the underlying problem. The multiplication of the basis elements usually provide a natural algebra on the corresponding sequence space. For instance, the space of Taylor coefficients equipped with the Cauchy product forms a [Banach algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_algebra). Currently, the RadiiPolynomial library does not automatically propagate error bounds which limits us to polynomial nonlinearities. However, note that by means of strategies akin to *automatic differentiation*, it is possible to generate, for a large class of differential equations, an auxiliary polynomial system of equations.[^1] To illustrate, the differential equation ``\frac{d}{dt} u(t) = e^{u(t)} - 1``, with initial condition ``u(0) = u_0``, can be solved by studying the system

```math
\begin{cases}
\displaystyle \frac{d}{dt} u(t) = v(t) - 1,\\
\displaystyle \frac{d}{dt} v(t) = v(t)(v(t) - 1),\\
u(0) = u_0,\, v(0) = e^{u_0}.
\end{cases}
```

## [Radii polynomial approach](@id radii_polynomial_approach)

Given a problem in dynamical systems (e.g. existence of an invariant set, stability analysis, etc.), one approach of computer-assisted proofs consists in representing the desired solution ``\tilde{x}`` as an isolated fixed-point in a Banach space ``X``. The assistance of the computer is used to verify that the corresponding fixed-point operator ``T`` abides by the [Banach Fixed-Point Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_fixed-point_theorem) in a vicinity of a numerical approximation ``\bar{x}``. Note that a particular case of this procedure is the well-known [Newton-Kantorovich Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kantorovich_theorem).

We refer to this strategy as the *radii polynomial approach* since, in practice, we prove the contraction of ``T`` in balls whose radii are determined by the roots of a polynomial. For the sake of completeness, we report the fundamental principles in the following theorem.

Let ``X`` be a Banach space, ``U`` an open subset of ``X``, ``T \in C^1(U, X)`` an operator, ``\bar{x} \in U`` and ``R > 0`` such that ``\text{cl}( B_R(\bar{x}) ) \subset U``.
- (First-order) Suppose ``Y, Z_1 \ge 0`` satisfy
```math
\begin{aligned}
|T(\bar{x}) - \bar{x}|_X &\le Y,\\
\sup_{x \in \text{cl}( B_R(\bar{x}) )} |DT(x)|_{\mathscr{B}(X, X)} &\le Z_1,
\end{aligned}
```
and define the *radii polynomial* by ``p(r) \bydef Y + (Z_1 - 1) r``.
If there exists a *radius* ``\bar{r} \in [0, R]`` such that ``p(\bar{r}) \le 0`` and ``Z_1 < 1``, then ``T`` has a unique fixed-point ``\tilde{x} \in \text{cl}( B_{\bar{r}} (\bar{x}) )``.
- (Second-order) Suppose ``Y, Z_1, Z_2 \ge 0`` satisfy
```math
\begin{aligned}
|T(\bar{x}) - \bar{x}|_X &\le Y,\\
|DT(\bar{x})|_{\mathscr{B}(X, X)} &\le Z_1,\\
|DT(x) - DT(\bar{x})|_{\mathscr{B}(X, X)} &\le Z_2 |x - \bar{x}|_X, \qquad \text{for all } x \in \text{cl}( B_R(\bar{x}) ),
\end{aligned}
```
and define the *radii polynomial* by ``p(r) \bydef Y + (Z_1 - 1) r + \frac{Z_2}{2} r^2``.
If there exists a *radius* ``\bar{r} \in [0, R]`` such that ``p(\bar{r}) \le 0`` and ``Z_1 + Z_2 \bar{r} < 1``, then ``T`` has a unique fixed-point ``\tilde{x} \in \text{cl}( B_{\bar{r}} (\bar{x}) )``.

The set of all possible radii is called the *interval of existence*. Its minimum gives the sharpest computed a posteriori error bound on ``\bar{x}``. On the other hand, its maximum represents the largest computed radius of the ball, centred at ``\bar{x}``, within which the solution is unique.
